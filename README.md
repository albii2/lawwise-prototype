# LawWise™ Prototype

**LawWise™** is an AI-powered legal assistant for underserved individuals navigating child support, traffic court, and family civil legal issues — starting in Minnesota.

Built by [Auqueith Bradshaw](https://github.com/albii2), a father, coach, and civil rights advocate with lived experience in wrongful child support enforcement, LawWise aims to:

- Convert confusing court letters into plain English
- Auto-generate legally sound motions and declarations
- Explain your rights (14th Amendment, Title VI, Due Process)
- Help you self-advocate when legal aid isn’t enough

> “Justice in plain language.”
